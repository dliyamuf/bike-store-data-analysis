## **DATABASE SETUP**
### **SCHEMA DIAGRAM**
I used snowflake schema to define relationship between tables. I split into two parts: sales and production.
[Schema Diagram](https://github.com/dliyamuf/bike-store-data-analysis/blob/main/fig/database-model.png)

### **CREATE DATABASE**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE bikestore_db;
USE bikestore_db;
```
### **CREATE AND LOAD TABLES**
Tables comprises of sales_customers, sales_order_items, sales_orders, sales_staffs, production_brands, production_categories, production_product, production_stocks, and production_stores.
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_customers(
customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(30),
last_name VARCHAR(30),
phone VARCHAR(20),
email VARCHAR(50),
street VARCHAR(50),
city VARCHAR(25),
state VARCHAR(25),
zip_code VARCHAR(10)
);
```
Then, load the data of tables from csv files.
```sql
-- load data table sales_customers
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:\Users\hp\Downloads\bikestore\customers.csv'
INTO TABLE sales_customers
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

## **SQL QUERIES**
### **ORDER AND SALES ANALYSIS**
