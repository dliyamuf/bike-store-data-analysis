## **DATABASE SETUP**
### **SCHEMA DIAGRAM**
I used snowflake schema to define relationship between tables. I split into two parts: sales and production.

### **CREATE DATABASE**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE bikestore_db;
USE bikestore_db;
```
### **CREATE AND LOAD TABLES**
Tables comprises of sales_customers, sales_order_items, sales_orders, sales_staffs, production_brands, production_categories, production_product, production_stocks, and production_stores.
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_customers(
customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(30),
last_name VARCHAR(30),
phone VARCHAR(20),
email VARCHAR(50),
street VARCHAR(50),
city VARCHAR(25),
state VARCHAR(25),
zip_code VARCHAR(10)
);
```
Then, load the data of tables from csv files.
```sql
-- load data table sales_customers
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:\Users\hp\Downloads\bikestore\customers.csv'
INTO TABLE sales_customers
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

## **SQL QUERIES**
### **ORDER AND SALES ANALYSIS**
- **What's total revenue of all bike stores each year?**
```sql
-- creating new table named total_price
ALTER TABLE sales_order_items
ADD total_price FLOAT;
UPDATE sales_order_items
SET total_price = (quantity*list_price - (1-list_price*discount));

-- total revenue per year
SELECT 
YEAR(o.order_date) AS order_year,
SUM(i.total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_orders AS o
JOIN sales_order_items AS i
ON o.order_id = i.order_id
GROUP BY
YEAR(o.order_date)
ORDER BY
YEAR(o.order_date) DESC;

-- alternative solution for Q1 without creating new column
WITH total_order_data AS (
SELECT 
order_id, 
quantity, 
list_price, 
discount,
(quantity* list_price - (1-list_price*discount)) AS total_price
FROM sales_order_items
)
SELECT 
YEAR(o.order_date) AS order_year,
SUM(i.total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_orders AS o
JOIN total_order_data AS i
ON o.order_id = i.order_id
GROUP BY
YEAR(o.order_date)
ORDER BY
YEAR(o.order_date);
```
Insight: The highest revenue is in 2017, the trend shows total revenue is fluctuating, with 2018 having the lowest revenue.

- **What's total revenue per month?**
```sql

 FROM sales_orders AS o
 JOIN sales_order_items AS i
 ON o.order_id = i.order_id 
 GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date)
ORDER BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date);
```
Insight: The highest revenue was in April 2018.

- **How much total revenue each month across product category?**
```sql
SELECT 
 c.category_name,

 MONTH(o.order_date) AS order_month,
 SUM(i.total_price) AS total_revenue
 FROM sales_orders AS o
 JOIN sales_order_items AS i
 ON o.order_id = i.order_id 
 JOIN production_product AS p
 ON i.product_id = p.product_id
 JOIN production_categories AS c
 ON p.category_id = c.category_id
 GROUP BY c.category_name, YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date)
 ORDER BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date);
```
Insight: The highest revenue from the product category was generated by road bikes in April 2018.

- **How much total unit sold each year?**
```sql
SELECT 
YEAR(o.order_date) AS order_year,

ON o.order_id = i.order_id
GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date)
ORDER BY YEAR(o.order_date);
```
Insight: Most unit sold happened in 2017.

### **STORES ANALYSIS**
- **What's total revenue per stores?**
```sql
SELECT  
s.store_name,
SUM(i.total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_orders AS o
JOIN production_stores AS s
ON o.store_id = s.store_id
JOIN sales_order_items AS i
ON o.order_id = i.order_id
GROUP BY s.store_name
ORDER BY SUM(i.total_price) DESC;
```
